# Developer Note

Since Receipt-App was made using electron, debug an error has become way easier, so if an issue ever occurs all you have to do is right click on "Menu +", which creates a new popup, on that popup right click on "View +", then finally left click on "Toggle Developers Tools" and when a new window shows up, head over to the console, to see what exactly cause the issue.

Because it is so easy to see an issue, it becomes easier to report it, so when ever you spot an issue, send me an email and I will see try to fix it when ever I have an oppurtunity.
